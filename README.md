# OsrsRLcompanion
Note: We're not affiliated with RuneLite, this is an independant OSRS companion app which takes advantage of RuneLite's API.

# About
An android application to aid playing Old School Runescape with RuneLite integration. Base features will include farm timers, GE Price Checking, and Player Lookup.

# So a RuneLite client for mobile?
No. You couldn't for example do a herb run on OSRS mobile and it would update the herb timer on RuneLite. This is simply a tool you can use if you've stepped away from your desktop if you use RuneLite.
